## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ananth Bhimireddy, a graduate student and research assistant at IUPUI. I am currently working as a researcher in the field of deep learning and natural language processing. I am actively looking for internships and full-time opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Here are a few details about myself.

### Work Experience :computer:

##### Research Assistant - IUPUI
> Aug 2019 - Present

I am currently working on two parallel research streams. One of them deals with identifying and reducing the time taken to diagnose rare diseases. This involves extracting symptoms, disease/disorders of a given patient over a period of time to narrow down the probability of the sickness being a certain disease. The research is being conducted at [Data Lab - IUPUI](https://data.soic.iupui.edu/people.html) under the esteemed guidance of [Prof. Sunandan Chakraborty](https://soic.iupui.edu/people/sunandan-chakraborty/). We are using Natural Language Processing and information extraction techniques to extract the relevant entities from patient notes and model them accordingly.

On the other research stream, We are working on predicting Blood Glucose Level of Diabetic patients to identify conditions such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. We used the Sequence-to-Sequence models and transfer learning to train the time-series models and predict blood glucose for a certain period of time. This research was performed at [PLHI Lab - IUPUI](https://plhi.sitehost.iu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Saptarshi Purkayastha](https://soic.iupui.edu/people/saptarshi-purkayastha/). The corresponding code files can be found at [BGLP-Code](https://github.com/iupui-soic/bglp2).

##### Junior Data Scientist - GGK Technologies
> May 2018 - Jul 2019

As a Junior Data Scientist, I am responsible for developing data science pipelines for problems of various domains including healthcare, banking, and HR Analytics. The pipeline development includes data mining/collection, data processing, applying machine learning and deep learning models, model improvement. I have worked extensively on Natural Language Processing Problems and Deep Learning Algorithms.

### Other Research Projects :books:

##### Fake News Detection - IUPUI Data Lab
* Developed a language model using Siamese BERT Model to detect fake news in news articles from "Liar, Liar pants on fire" dataset.
* Used news-statement, metadata, true and false statements from the authors to build the features for modeling. More details and code for the project can be found at [Fake_News_Detection](https://github.com/anbhimi/fake_news_detection).

##### Diagnosis and Procedure codes from MIMIC notes - IUPUI PLHI Lab
* The research paper published as a part of this research project can be found at [MIMIC-Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07507).

##### ImageBERT for Chest X-ray classification - IUPUI PLHI Lab
* The research paper published as a part of this research project can be found at [ImageBERT-Chest-Paper](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/23153).
