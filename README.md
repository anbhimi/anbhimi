## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ananth Bhimireddy, a graduate student and research assistant at IUPUI. I am currently working as a Data Science Intern at Unisoft Solutions LLC and a researcher in the field of deep learning and natural language processing at IUPUI. I am actively looking for full-time opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Here are a few details about myself.

### Work Experience :computer:

##### Data Science Intern - Unisoft Solutions LLC
> Oct 2020 - Present

I am working as Data Scientist for a client (EmeraldX) where I am working on Data Analysis, Visualizations and automating the daily operations of the client. We are building a unified data repository regarding customers to apply Machine Learning models and extract insights from the data.

##### Data Scientist (Research Assistant) - IUPUI
> Aug 2019 - Present

I am currently working on two parallel research streams. One of them deals with identifying and reducing the time taken to diagnose rare diseases. This involves extracting symptoms, disease/disorders of a given patient over a period of time to narrow down the probability of the sickness being a certain disease. The research is being conducted at [Data Lab - IUPUI](https://data.soic.iupui.edu/people.html) under the esteemed guidance of [Prof. Sunandan Chakraborty](https://soic.iupui.edu/people/sunandan-chakraborty/). We are using Natural Language Processing and information extraction techniques to extract the relevant entities from patient notes and model them accordingly.

On the other research stream, I am working on determining the prediction power of metadata in clinical studies. The research includes building models from patient notes and Images (such as Chest X-rays) and comparing the results with the models built from metadata such as patient demographic information, lab events and prescriptions. This research was performed at [PLHI Lab - IUPUI](https://plhi.sitehost.iu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Saptarshi Purkayastha](https://soic.iupui.edu/people/saptarshi-purkayastha/).

##### Junior Data Scientist - GGK Technologies
> May 2018 - Jul 2019

As a Junior Data Scientist, I am responsible for developing data science pipelines for problems of various domains including healthcare, banking, and HR Analytics. The pipeline development includes data mining/collection, data processing, applying machine learning and deep learning models, model improvement. I have worked extensively on Natural Language Processing Problems and Deep Learning Algorithms.
