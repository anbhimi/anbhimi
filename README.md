## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am Ananth, a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Enthusiast. Currently, I am working as a Systems Software Engineer in the field of ML at Emory University. I recently (May 2021) graduated from Indiana University - Indianapolis majoring in Applied Data Science.

I have worked for 4 years in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science in various roles including Software Engineer, Research Assistant and Data Scientist.

### Work Experience

##### Systems Software Engineer (Machine Learning) - Emory University
> Jun 2021 - Present

- Developed and validated complex machine learning and deep learning models on medical images (Chest X-Rays, Mammograms and Digital Hand Images) to identify racial bias.
- Developed various modules in [Niffler](https://github.com/Emory-HITI/Niffler/) - A DICOM Framework for Machine Learning and Processing Pipelines.
- Working with a client to develop a Deep Learning Pipeline to detect cancers in Mammogram Images.

##### Data Science Intern - Unisoft Solutions LLC
> Oct 2020 - May 2021
 
- Kick-Started a Machine Learning project to cluster the customers based on their interests and market to their needs accordingly. 
- Worked with a client on Data Analysis, Visualizations and automated operations to analyze the data quality. We built a unified data repository of customers to apply Machine Learning models and extract insights from the data.
- Developed applications to store, access, retrieve, analyze and build models on the data from the unified data repository.

##### Research Assistant (Data Science and Machine Learning) - IUPUI
> Aug 2019 - May 2021

- Implemented a time-series forecasting model to forecast the blood-glucose levels of diabetic patients to treat hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. The research paper has been accepted at [ECAI - 2020](https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10188463).
- Implemented a Few-Shot Learning algorithm to fine-tune a few image triplets created from [CheXpert dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) and improved pathology classification results by decreasing false-positives and false-negitives. We have experimented with usual Few-Shot Learning and Incremental Few-Shot Learning models. [MarginRakingLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MarginRankingLoss.html) is used as the loss function to implement Few-Shot Learning model. This research was performed at [PLHI Lab - IUPUI](https://plhi.sitehost.iu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Saptarshi Purkayastha](https://soic.iupui.edu/people/saptarshi-purkayastha/).
- Worked on developing language models to identify and reduce the time taken to diagnose rare diseases from patient notes. This involved extracting symptoms, disease/disorders of a given patient over a period of time to narrow down the probability of the sickness being a certain disease. The research is being conducted at [Data Lab - IUPUI](https://data.soic.iupui.edu/people.html) under the esteemed guidance of [Prof. Sunandan Chakraborty](https://soic.iupui.edu/people/sunandan-chakraborty/). We used Entity and Information Extraction techniques to extract the relevant entities from patient notes and model them accordingly.
- Worked on a POC to develop and implement a [Natural Language Processing algorithm](https://github.com/anbhimi/fake_news_detection) to detect and explain the presence of fake and false new statements collected from various media outlets in the US.

##### Software Engineer (Machine Learning) - GGK Technologies
> Dec 2017 - Jul 2019

- Developed a Machine Learning solution (classification model) on highly sensitive healthcare data to reduce the time taken by the operations team by 60% to determine the process of claim-denial in the health insurance industry.
- Implemented a Language Processing Model to process and rank resumes based on experience, education against a given job description as a part of a pilot project. The pilot project was not continued because of the discrepancies and efficiency issues in the Language Model.
